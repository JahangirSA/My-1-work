<h2>Childhood</h2>
<p>I was born on April 9, 2006. First, we lived in my grandmother's on my father's side flat. When my parents was at job, I was nursed by aunts, uncles and grandparents. Then we lived in two rental apartment. 'Cause I didn't go to the kindergarten, i often spent time with my grandmother on mother's side and my aunt. Also I like to spent time with my cousins. I like it to this day. I was liked and like t this day, when my grandmothers aunt and mother cooking, spending time with me and invest in my development. When I was 4, my little brother was born. I was an unusual child. I don't like, when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They cut the bread thickly</li>
    <li>I'm being squeezed</li>
    <li>They talk to me rudely</li>
    <li>Something is  happening what I do not want</li>
    <li>Someone points out to me</li>
    <li>Someone bothers me</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very grateful to my dad that he gave me to chess. They taught me:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Never give up</li>
    <li>One must learn and practice every day</li>
    <li>Never relax ahead of time</li>
    <li>Think fast</li>
    <li>Never get distracted</li>
    <li>Always have a plan</li>
</ol>
